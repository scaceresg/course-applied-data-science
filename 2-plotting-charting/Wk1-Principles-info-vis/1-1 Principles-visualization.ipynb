Ensure you aren't misleading yourself. Skepticism is an important skill for data scientists. 2) to be honest with our audience. There are ways of displaying data which are more truthful than others.\n",

    "* **Beauty**: Depends on situational and context factors, as well as understanding your audience.\n",

    "* **Insightful**: Graphs shouldn't just replicate data in tables, but they should draw the viewer in such that the viewer has an eureka! moment.\n",
